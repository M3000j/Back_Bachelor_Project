Backgammon Programm
This backgammon game has three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. For the Easy level, possible moves are selected randomly for each dice. For the medium and hard parts, a customized decision tree was used.
For the medium level, The depth of the decision tree is considered one. I used the evaluation function to evaluate each possible checker's action and select the best move with the highest score. In the hard level, the depth of the decision tree will increase to 4 levels. Moreover, some places on the board are more important or strategic than others. So, the algorithm considers weights for each move based on their location.
For example, if the number of dice is 3 and 4, the possible moves of 3 are first identified. Based on these possible moves, the possible movements of the four are then determined. This process will create the left branch of the tree. In the next phase, possible actions of 4 are found, and based on these possible moves, corresponding actions of 3 are located, which creates the right branch tree.
Moves are scored using the evaluation function, and the highest ones are selected from each branch. The maximum score is determined by comparing the highest scores from the two branches, and the following actions are chosen from the first selected branch.
